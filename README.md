These code files contain information from projects carried out at the Singular Center for Intelligent Technologies 
at the University of Santiago de Compostela, focused on the analysis of marbling in slices of Serrano ham. 

This work is aimed at companies in Spain interested in quality analysis. We employed various classifiers, 
statistical analyses, and Friedman techniques. These are condensed versions of the original code, presented 
for educational purposes and as part of a portfolio showcasing the projects I have undertaken throughout my 
academic and professional journey.
