These code files contain information from projects carried out at the Singular Center for Intelligent Technologies at the University of Santiago de Compostela, focused on the analysis of marbling in slices of Serrano ham. This work is aimed at companies in Spain interested in quality analysis. We employed various classifiers, statistical analyses, and Friedman techniques.

In addition, this collection includes code from a project developed at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Legnaro, Italy, which involved creating classifiers and autoencoders for reconstructing signals generated by a gamma spectroscopy experiment. This technique, explored through the use of autoencoders, aims to replace the currently employed pulse discrimination analysis methods.

These are condensed versions of the original code, presented for educational purposes and as part of a portfolio showcasing the projects I have undertaken throughout my academic and professional journey.
